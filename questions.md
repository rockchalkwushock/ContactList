# Questions for Mario or Community




### Things I want to do with this project:

1) autocomplete:
    a) email
    b) country
    c) postal-code
    - To do this I must use a jQuery Plug-in.

2) I want to set it up so that when the user inputs #country...
    a) submit event takes in user input.
    b) sends user input to API (or countrydata.json)
    c) retrieves country code.
    d) appends country code too phone number input
    e) so that it is set up as an non-editable portion of the input field.

3) I want to set it up so that when the user inputs #zipcode...
    a) submit event takes in user input.
    b) sends user input to Google Maps API.
    c) retrieves City & State.
    d) appends city & state to corresponding 'read-only' input fields.
    e) city & state input fields will be set to hidden and upon appending the data become visible to the user.
